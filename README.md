# Time-Series

Hi

Thanks for visiting my time series respository.

In this repository, I learn how to code timeseries using pandas for 

1. datatime index
2. data range
3. holidays & custom business days
4. date time
5. fiscal periods
6. timezone handling
7. shift

Datasets are from codebasics from youtube.
